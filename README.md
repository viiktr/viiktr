👋🏻 Hello there (General Ke....), dear visitor! I’m @viiktr!

Very new to github and development, I’m interested in making data understandable and presentable, exploring the depths of software and AI.
 I’m currently concentrated on learning Python and SQL but also doing different courses on BI, Agile, ML and Mainframe.🔹
